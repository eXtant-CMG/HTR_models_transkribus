# HTR_models_transkribus

In collaboration with the Letterenhuis, we trained HTR models in Transkribus to automatically transcribe the handwriting of **Hugo Claus (20th century, Dutch)** and **Johanna Courtmans-Berchmans (19th century, Dutch, cursive handwriting)**. 

- Hugo Claus model: 3.61% CER on train set, **3.80%** CER on test set
- Johanna Courtmans-Berchmans model: 4.30% CER on train set, **8.30%** on test set
